### Addon for the Bedrock Addons 8K Jam!
The jam theme is "into the cosmos," but I wanted to expand beyond the idea of planets. The minecraft cosmos, unlike the real world, is split between two sides; the overworld and the void. I decided to expand the void since it was a... uh... bit of a boring place!

# Gameplay
#### The Beginning
VoidDweller adds post-wither content to survival worlds by introducing a new variety of extremely powerful loot and effects. Withers now drop both Nether Stars and Void Stars, the latter of which can be used to craft a Void Pylon, allowing entry to the void. Entering the void blasts you out from the sky as a voidling.

#### Void Mobs
Voidlings can infect other mobs near them that are susceptible to the void, mutilating them in many different ways. Every void-variant mob has powerful custom drops, enabling tons of new gameplay styles and abilities. Void mobs deal massive void damage to anything near that is insusceptible to the void. Stepping on a beacon will immediately cleanse you.

# Content
#### Stuff
VoidDweller introduces **10 new items**, **5 new blocks**, and **10 new unique mob variants**, all accessible from survival mode. Additionally, a full 1,800 word lore accessed by unique rare drops from the new "void mob" variants.

#### Supercharged Loot
Use new, powerful loot dropped from void mobs to change up the game, inflicting area-of-effect damage and other various effects; **just by having it in your inventory!** Some items additionally continue to have effects when dropped on the ground, enabling new kinds of farms or anything else similar. Discover all ten new items!

#### Blocks
Besides having a block which can break bedrock, VoidDweller also adds four other blocks for construction. 

> **Note**<br />
> Lore drops inspired by Risk of Rain 2.

# Programming
VoidDweller's logic was developed using my other project, [MCCompiled](https://github.com/7UKECREAT0R/MCCompiled), a programming language designed for Minecraft development. There was still a bunch of JSON used for the Minecraft stuff, but the primary project logic is available in MCCompiled.
