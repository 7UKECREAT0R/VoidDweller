My name is Quincy Hathson, working for the Ender Corporation, the date is 34-1-59. We have been working steadily on the mass excavation of bedrock as part of Project Under. This set of audio logs is to be used as a record for everything we find. Somebody fell in today; the on-site guys described the incident as a couple of seconds of awe followed by a bright, deep-purple flash causing the subject to immediately disappear. A couple of seconds later, half the island was shook by a massive impact. Something happened there, I just have to find out what.

I was sent out with Expedition Team Zeta today to investigate the source of the impact. Not even fifty feet from the laboratory, we discovered a massive crater, about twice the size of a Creeper's detonation. Something was different about it. The ground had transformed, as if the molecules themselves had completely recomposed into a new substance. It is colored dark purple, and moves actively. There isn't a single living cell in the block, but yet the composition looks entirely alive. It's physically the opposite of life, but yet it seems living. We have never seen this block before in our 160 years of research.

## Sheep

A couple days after the void incident, a scout supposedly ran into a group of--creatures about a mile from the laboratory. He crawled back to the lab covered in welts and burns, as if his skin began to collapse under some kind of vaccum. The pain he is experiencing was graded as a nine out of ten, and his muscles have been continuously convulsing. We have him under spider-eye based sedatives to try and ease the pain, but the wounds are not healing. Whatever he found, it sure messed him the hell up.

Under a heavy dose of Weakness and golden apple, we managed to perform our first discussion with Patient V. It was a lot to--ah--here, I'll stick the recording into the jukebox so you can hear it for yourself.

`[Various Static Noises]`

Hathson: Can you understand what I am saying?

PV: y-yes, sir.

Hathson: Start from when you first saw the creature. Or was it multiple?

PV: m-m-many.

Hathson: What did they look like?

PV: purple... all over. `[Long Pause]` the skin--it was--moving.

Hathson: Did it resemble any known creatures?

PV: yes. it was like--a herd. of sheep. it's face... had--uh--melted. or something.

Hathson: Did you say "melted?"

PV: it only had one eye. i saw it. it looked s-s-straight at me.
  
PV: it's wool was wet and hard.

Hathson: Did they attack you?

PV: n--no it... was just walking around. i got too close and it... felt like i was being sucked into myself.
  
PV: the... sheep walked away. like nothing happened.

Hathson: That's all we need to know. Thank you. Get some rest.

## Cow
`[40-1-59 CPA v45.3]`

`[Attempt to translate...]`

As of today, we have designated these new mobs as "void" creatures. A search squad was sent out to capture one, most of which were violently burned and melted during the endeavor. At the very least, we have one in the lab to study. This one is a cow, with the same mutations of the sheep as described by Patient V. The void cow's utters and lower-body have been mutilated beyond recognition, it's eyeballs have rotted away, and it's sockets have conjoined, leaving just one empty cavity on the skull. I cannot begin to imagine the overwhelming pain that this... creature is experiencing, and yet... It behaves as if nothing is wrong.

Fish appear to be held to the same standard as some other mobs when it comes to what we're now calling "void energy," meaning that we are safe from needing to contain void creatures beyond a certain extent. It's curious, really. Some mobs are immediately overtaken, and some are affected similarly to humans, experiencing an incredible vacuum effect causing boils and bleeding. The only real relation we can make to the "infection" of mobs is the amount of time they have been in the world. So far, we have been able to spread void energy to four distinct passive mobs: Cow, Sheep, Pig, and Chicken. All of which are the oldest creatures in our worlds. We have yet to test on hostiles.

## Chicken
`[45-1-59 CPA v46.0]`

`[Attempt to translate...]`

Ongoing attempts to study void creatures repeatedly come up with nothing. The only thing we can scientifically pull from this--anomaly--is what we can see with our own eyes. We rebooted the mob farm today, trying to grab one of each known species pertaining to the darkness family. Research will continue in the morning, though it's been tough to sleep at all in the past few days. Three days ago, security apprehended two researchers trying to throw themselves into the void. I don't quite know what to make of it... Did their curiosity get the best of them or is something going seriously bad here? Regardless, I've made the conscious decision to not stay around any void creatures for too long. For my own sake.

## Zombie
`[46-1-59 CPA v46.0]`

`[Attempt to translate...]`

First tests with hostile mobs were undoubtedly the most interesting. Zombies accepted the infection, and seem to rapidly grow some kind of parasite. It seems to intelligently collect nutrients from anything near it using a variant of void energy. The parasite also doesn't affect its host too much, as if it knows that killing them would also strand it. We have section 6F trying to use the parasite for some kind of automation... or something along those lines.

## Creeper
`[48-1-59 CPA v46.1]`

`[Attempt to translate...]`

Upon being infected, Creepers lose their bumpy form and turn--almost smooth. Their explosive mechanisms immediately become the opposite of what they once were. Rather than being controlled and precise, the explosive mechanism becomes spontaneous and random, causing creepers to be much more unstable than they were previously. After death, the gunpowder dropped from a Void Creeper is safe to touch, though any additional mobs that draw near are immediately obliterated by a massive explosion. The damage to the warehouse must be repaired before experiments continue.

## Spider
`[12-2-59 CPA v46.1]`

`[Attempt to translate...]`

Spiders, when infected, are constantly hostile. Their poison has been amplified to indiscernible amounts, and every part of their bodies begin to contort and ferment. Their eyes no longer seem functional, though they are still able to accurately track anything they see. A curious effect that has been seen repeatedly from void creatures. The flesh from Void Spiders consistently fires microscopic spores at any nearby creature that is not also infected by the void. The supply never seems to run out. I have accelerated this information to the Alpha crew; perhaps it could be used as some kind of energy source.

## Skeleton
`[15-2-59 CPA v46.8]`

`[Attempt to translate...]`

The Skeleton. We begun to take vitals once the void had taken one over, but by the time we had, it had... completely transformed. The bones had begun to char and crumble. Eventually, all of the void energy had completely left the skeleton, though we didn't believe it was a skeleton any longer. It was entirely black, and still affected everything near it, just in a different way. The team decided to call this new type of Skeleton a "Wither Skeleton" due to the nature of how it withered and burned.

`[End of Transcript]`

`[16-2-59 CPA v46.8]`

Through a second attempt, we managed to "re-charge" a Wither Skeleton with void energy again. It seems as though the vacuum of void energy cancels the effects of Withering. Tomorrow we will test how the Wither Skeletons interact with each other.

`[End of Transcript]`

`[17-2-59 CPA v47.0]`

After forming two new Wither Skeletons, they did not act any out of the ordinary. They simply existed with each other. We released a void creature in, charging the two skeletons. They sort-of merged together into one, flinging withering spores everywhere. We quickly dispatched of the creature. Attempt number two consisted of three Wither Skeletons. After being recharged, all three Skeletons began to conjoin together forming a creature I cannot even begin to explain. It's trapped inside the test chamber, but it wants out. We deemed it a "Wither," since four Wither Skeletons yielded no result other than the merging into two half-Withers. Three seems to be the prime number here. Tests with partial bodies of Wither Skeletons have yet to be authorized.

## Wither Skeleton
`[18-2-59 CPA v47.0]`

`[Attempt to translate...]`

Seven researchers threw themselves into the void today, all of which fell from the sky. We retrieved them all as Wither Skeletons. Whatever the hell is happening, it's happening fast. Nobody on this island is going to live if this chaos continues. Maybe it can't be stopped, I-I don't know anymore. I know the Wither is behind this, but it continues to be too powerful to even touch. Withering penetrates any and all armor we have, and the closest combat brewery is weeks away. We sent a letter to them, the only objective now is to hold out until then.

Fifty-seven people yesterday went into the void. And we're not talking, you know--some mindless zombie trying to break past our barriers. These are the smartest people in the [Expletive] world; they know what they want and exactly how to get to it. Screw the stupid potions, it's not going to happen in time. I don't even know if a Wither is vulnerable to that kind of thing. We placed an order for an entire shulker of obsidian, set to be delivered in three days. The idea is to surround the island in four towering nether portals; a full 319 by 201 area. Everything that tries to leave will end up there and burn.

## Wither
`[20-2-59 CPA v47.0]`

`[Attempt to translate...]`

Forty-three casualties yesterday. Something is speaking inside my head, I can't make out what it's saying, and it's terrifying. The sensation is like an--intelligent tinnitus that can't leave me alone; it doesn't even care. I can't believe it's come to this.

`[End of Transcript]`

`[21-2-59 CPA v47.0]`

The voice is now clear, everybody in the laboratory is commenting on it now. We've tried everything to kill the Wither, to no avail. It looked straight at me and talked. I heard every word: "You can't fight back, let us take over. Jump in." I just want to give up and obey, but, ...no. Tomorrow is the day.
